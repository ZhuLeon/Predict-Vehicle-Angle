# Abstract

This dataset contains photos of streets, taken from the roof of a car. We develop an algorithm to estimate the position and orientation of vehicles.

*Note that rotation values are angles expressed in radians, relative to the camera.*

The primary data is images of cars and related pose information. The pose information is formatted as strings, as follows:

model type, yaw, pitch, roll, x, y, z
